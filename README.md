# Prose Tinted Glasses Bookshelf

This is an interactive bookshelf app that allows users to view details about books and add them to their personal bookshelves as either books they have read or books they would like to add to their To-Be-Read list (TBR). Users can also add books to the database and leave reviews.

### Next Steps

AAU, I'd like to see a summary of the review scores for a book on the details page
AAU, I want to be able to see all the books written by a particular author
AAU, I want to be able to see all the books in a particular genre
AAU, I want to see if a book is part of a series, and be able to view that series
AAU, I want to be able to browse all podcast episodes in addition to all books
AAU, I want to be able to see what books are associated with any given podcast episode

Look into consuming an API that has a book library I can draw on instead of adding all books manually

Implement additonal Model for Episodes; allow users to review and favorite episodes; associate episodes with the books they feature
